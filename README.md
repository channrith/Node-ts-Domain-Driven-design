## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) 
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a methodology for structuring complex software projects around business domain concepts. When organizing a Node.js TypeScript project following DDD principles, you'll typically have several layers representing different aspects of your application. Here's a suggested folder structure:
```
src/
│
├── domain/
│   ├── entity/
│   │   ├── User.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   ├── value-object/
│   │   ├── Email.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   ├── repository/
│   │   ├── UserRepository.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   ├── service/
│   │   ├── UserService.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   └── ...
│
├── application/
│   ├── use-case/
│   │   ├── CreateUserUseCase.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   ├── service/
│   │   ├── AuthenticationService.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   └── ...
│
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── persistence/
│   │   ├── UserRepositoryImpl.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── EmailService.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   └── ...
│
└── presentation/
    ├── controller/
    │   ├── UserController.ts
    │   └── ...
    │
    └── ...
```

Let's break down each folder:

1. Domain: This layer contains the core domain logic of your application. It includes entities, value objects, repositories, and services.

- Entity: Represents domain objects with a unique identity. For example, a User entity.
- Value Object: Represents concepts without an identity. For example, an Email value object.
- Repository: Defines interfaces for data access operations related to entities. For example, a UserRepository.
- Service: Contains domain services that don't belong to any specific entity but operate on multiple entities. For example, a UserService.
2. Application: This layer contains application-specific logic like use cases and services. It acts as an intermediary between the domain and infrastructure layers.

- Use Case: Defines application-specific operations or interactions. For example, a CreateUserUseCase.
- Service: Contains application services. These services coordinate domain objects to accomplish specific tasks.
3. Infrastructure: This layer contains implementation details like database access, external services, etc.

- Persistence: Contains implementations of repositories. For example, a UserRepositoryImpl.
- Services: Contains implementations of external services. For example, an EmailService.
4. Presentation: This layer deals with interaction with the outside world, such as HTTP controllers, CLI interfaces, etc.

- Controller: Handles incoming requests, interacts with application services, and sends responses.

This structure helps to separate concerns and maintain a clear separation of layers. Additionally, each layer depends only on the layers directly below it, promoting modularity and easier testing.
